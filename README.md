# EU-SILC Setup Files

These are modified versions of the Setup files produced and distributed by [GESIS](https://www.gesis.org/en/missy/materials/EU-SILC/setups).

The only modification to the original GESIS files are in the specification of directories in the individual files.

Setup_ver_2021_04 is written for the spring 2021 EU-SILC data release.
Setup_ver_2022_03 is written for the spring 2022 EU-SILC data release.

To run:
1. unzip the encrypted CROSS file you received from Eurostat 
2. open SILC_setup_cross_ver_2021_03 / SILC_setup_cross_ver_2022_03 / SILC_setup_cross_ver_2022_release2
3. set your directories
4. run SILC_setup_cross_ver_2021_03 / SILC_setup_cross_ver_2022_03 / SILC_setup_cross_ver_2022_release2
